     There! Also checkout Arachnide's brother project.         <br>
                                                              <br>
     Similarities:
     <ul>
       <li> Both use SDL as base graphic library.</li>
       <li> Both are Open Source and released under the Gnu Public License.</li>
       <li> We are both hosted at SourceForge.</li>
       <li> UOP also focuses on UOX as it's primary server.</li>
       <li> We entered public around nearly at the same time. 
            (just 4 days difference :o)</li>
     </ul>
     <br>
     Differences:
     <ul>
       <li> UOP is written in C, while Arachnide is object oriented designed in C++.  <br>
            (Both C variants have their advantages and disadvantages.)</li>
       <li> Arachnide focuses on windows, while UOP has linux as development platform.<br>
            However I bet both can and will be easily ported to the 'other' OS.</li>
       <li> Today (21.11.2000) UOP has already networking implented...</li>

     Simple DirectMedia Layer is a cross-platform multimedia library designed to 
     provide fast access to the graphics framebuffer and audio device. It is used 
     by MPEG playback software, emulators, and many popular games, including the 
     award winning Linux port of "Civilization: Call To Power." Simple
