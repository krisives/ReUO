  The Client Identifaction Mechanism

<font face="arial,helvetica">
<li> First to dash forward: this here is just a recommandation, not a mandotory or anything defined by an 'offical' institute. <br>
     It's a system introduced by Arachnide and I hope current clients will turn over to join
     it, and of course that all future one's will respect it.

<br>
<br>
<p>
<li> So what it's all about? <br>
     Well the idea is to give the server a chance to know which clients 
     are connecting to it. This can have several benifits:
     <ul>
       <li> <i>Statistik purposes.</i> <br>
         A server admin can gain statistics about the clients which his users use.<br>
        <br>
       <li> <i>Protocol enhancement.</i> <br>
            A server could possible be able to talk an enhanced protocoll
            with 'friend' clients, which are capable to do so also. So if a 3rd party clients connects to
            a server, it can check if it's a friend client and if there is a matching enhancement 
            protocol. The client will realize the protocol chosen from the server in the 
            first answer. (details have to be defined, when necessary)<br>
            <br>
       <li> <i>Client denial.</i> <br>
            Well it doesn't sound too attractive for client developers in first place,
            but it can be quite an enhancement for server administration.
            Unsupported clients with known bugs which are a thread to server stability can
            so simply be rejected. This can also be used to reject old client versions, 
            if there is a newer ver. aviable, where some issues are fixed.
     </ul>
<br>
<br>
<p>
<li> Technical <br>
     Currently on every connection the first 4 bytes send by the client are the encryption seed.<br>
     A server emulator-3rd party client has never an intention to encrypt data, as this is only
     a waste on processor performance. As 3rd party talk unencrypted this seed can be used for the
     client identification mechanism. <br><br>
     The OSI client sends always the client IP as encryption seed. <br>
     In example: 47.11.8.15 <br>
     As the numbers 0 and 255 aren't legal IP adresses they can be used to seperate the OSI client from
     3rd party clients.  <br>
     <br>
     <b> Third party clients send 0 as very first byte. </b><br>
     <font size="-1"><ul>
       <li> The numbers 1 .. 254 are used by the OSI client. <br>
       <li> 255 can be used for future issues.<br>
       <li> I've heared that 15 has a special meaning, don't know exactly. (15.*.*.* is the HP net, 
       so anyone working there can't connect :o)<br>
       <li> Some servers (sphere) also take away 32 for it's console, but thats not matter 
       of this recommandation. 
    </ul>
    </font>
    <br>
    <b> Byte 2 identifies the client </b>
    See the table below which numbers are associated to which clients.
    <br>
    <b> Byte 3 and 4 allow to identify the client version. </b><br>
        The most self-evident and recommended is <i>MAJOR.MINOR </i>
    <br>
    So to summarize it up, the first four bytes are: <br> 
    <ul><br>
    <b> 0.CLIENT.MAJOR.MINOR</b> </br>
    </ul>
<br>
<br>
<p>
<li> Client association <br>
     Each client has it's identity number. These are in NO PARTICULAR ORDER. <br>
     <br>
     &gt;Should&lt; you develop your own client, and you are ready for first release simply send
     an email to <a href="mailto:anshil@gmx.net">anshil@gmx.net</a> so I can reserve a number for 
     you. <br>
     (However we can't assign too fast, since there are 'only' 251 left :o) <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     <center><table width="75%" border=1 cellpadding="2">

<p>
 <li> That was it! <br>
     Once again this is just a recommondation, nothing more. <br>
     <font size = "-1">
     Last time I checked sphere client used 0.0.0.0, but I hope in future 
     they will also roll over to this system....
