<!--=================================================================--->
<ul>
 
  Ultimate Melange is a GNU-client for UO-Emulators   
  (UOX3 is it's &quot;home&quot;-server).             <br>
                                                      <br>
  Primarily the project is written in java. This will allow
  to spawn over all operating systems, which have
  a "JAVA-JIT-VM" available. For windows and linux sun's
  hotspot-VM is recommended.                          
  (The Microsoft VM is no longer suppported!)         <br>
                                                      <br>
  However there are already parts written for windows
  in native c++ code, but this is currently only 
  experimental, since the last native MFC-grafics version 
  tends to be slower than the pure-java version.

</ul>                                                 
<!---================================================================--->
<br><font color = "00ff00" size=+1> <li> INSTALLATION </font> <br><br>
<!--=================================================================--->
<ul>

  Copy all files from the zip-file you got into a single
  directory. Take care to preserve internal directory
  structure if there is one.                             <br>
                                                         <br>
  You will need to have the .mul and .idx files of the 
  OSI client on your harddisk. Open the file 
  "umelange.ini", and set the variable "UOPath" to 
  directory where the .mul and .idx files reside.        <br>
                                                         <br>
  Since Ultimate Melange is written in java, it 
  requires a virtual machine to run in. For windows
  sun's hotspot VM is adviced, it comes with the JRE 1.3.
  You can get the windows VM here:                       <br>
  <a href="http://jsp2.java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/jre/download-windows.html">
  http://jsp2.java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/jre/download-windows.html
  </a>                                                   <br>
                                                         <br>
  Note: JRE/JDK 1.22 and below sre NOT recommended since they 
  don't have a just-in-time compiler included and run
  much too slow (1-2 frames per sec on a athlon 700, where
  it are 40 frames with hotspot ;)
  The microsoft VM is NOT supported. Some months of 
  development have shown that it is unreliable and full of
  bugs.                                                  <br>
                                                         <br>
  After installation of the JRE simply double-click
  >UMelange.jar< and the program should jump up.         <br>
                                                         <br>
  If you want to see &quot;stdout&quot; debug output you can also
  call                                                   <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
    java -jar UMelange.jar                               <br>
  in a DOS box. There, UMelange will show you what it    <br>
  is currently doing, and failure notices will also be
  written there.                                         <br>
                                                         <br>
  Next release (0.0.4) will also have a native wrapper 
  .exe you can simply click on, but you will still need
  to have the JRE installed!

<br><font color = "00ff00" size=+1> <li> MAIN TARGETS </font> <br><br>
<!--=================================================================--->
<ul>

  The project targets have now been written down, 
  since this is a good idea for all GPL projects.       <br>
  (At least i was told so. Well it doesn't hurt and
   should give it all a little more professional touch)    <br>
  However they are not "carved into stone", but should 
  just give some guidelines.                               <br>
                                                           <br>
  <hr><!-------------------------------------------------------->
  <font color = "ffff00">                                  <br>
  <ul>
    <li> 1: Allow playing on uo-emu's without the need to buy 
         a client.                                            <br>
                                                              <br>
    <li> 2: Allows to play from non-windows operating systems. <br>
                                                              <br>
    <li> 3: Give people the opportunity to learn a new high-level
         language in depth, which has a bright future         
         predicted.                                           <br>
                                                              <br>
    <li> 4: Due to the modular concept of the project, it could 
         support of another communication protocol.
         (especially the "Atlas" protocol from "Worldforge")  <br>
                                                              <br>
  </font> </ul>
  <hr><!-------------------------------------------------------->
                                                                <br>
  Some add-on explanations to the main-points:             <br> <br>
  <ol>
  <li> Note that the main target is allowing people to freely 
       play on EMU's, not on official OSI shards. 
       From myself (knoxos) I will do no efforts in implementing
       the latest OSI encryption protocols, giving people 
       the opportunity to login into the official UO shards.    <br>
                                                                <br>
       One thing that is directly derived from this point 
       are the graphics. Currently UMelange still requires
       the mul files, so you are still required to have the 
       client. Due to this the OpenSkin sub-project has just started.
       It will try to collect/draw all graphics needed to run
       the game. The media database of WorldForge has given
       a startup (trees), and UMelange version 0.0.4 will 
       bring the technical implementation of the skin
       interface.                                               <br>     
                                                                <br>
       Just let's pray some people might find some time to
       draw one or another graphic. If not, everyone will 
       always have to pay for a client, so from my point 
       of view, it's the community itself deciding on this.     <br>
                                                                <br>
       I think it should be an exciting idea to actually 
       really draw a new game, however people seem to prefer
       to stick around with exchanging graphics of always the
       very newest more cooler game on the market, and just don't 
       do anything since they say it'll all be too much work...
       As said the communtiy itself will decide if this will be 
       posssible.                                               <br>
                                                                <br>
       I don't see too bright, since I somewhat know the
       community and how lazy they all are if it 
       comes to actual doing instead of just talking, 
       posting and might quarrels, etc.                         <br>
                                                                <br>
       But <b>never</b> give up the hope!                       <br>
                                                                <br>
  <li> This point should be not too difficult since java will
       automatically spawn over almost all operating systems ;) <br>
                                                              <br>
       However it's important to keep it on top, since 
       version 0.0.4 of umelange will also use also the JNI
       (Java Native Interface) to optimize some time-consuming
       routines. Currently a development version already works 
       with a MFC-Window instead of the java2D API (AWT), 
       although it proved to be much slower then the AWT :(     <br>
                                                                <br>
       Having this as main target will ensure that there 
       always will be a pure-java version available, standing 
       by all native optimizations/ports.                       <br>
                                                                <br>
  <li> I will gladly explain any in-depths questions about 
       java regarding UMelange,  however since my energies 
       are limited, I rather got tired of explaining people 
       absolute basics, like how to invoke the java-compiler, 
       the difference between an applet and an application, 
       where to get the hotspot-VM, ...
       For all these things please visit:                       <br>
       <a href="http://java.sun.com/tutorial/index.html">
       http://java.sun.com/tutorial/index.html
       </a>                                                     <br>

       It has really good intro's and explanations, I myself 
       learned all my java knowledge just from there.      <br>
                                                              <br>
  <li> This is more a far-future thought, than anything
       particular already. Since the "reflection" concept
       of UME (separated worlds and display) it should 
       be possible to coexist inside the client. Future
       will reveal how this idea turns out....
  </ol>
</ul>
<!---================================================================--->
<br><font color = "00ff00" size=+1> <li> SIDE TARGETS </font> <br><br>
<!--=================================================================--->
<ul>

  The project structure allows much more than listed in
  the main targets. But since the resources are limited,
  powers are directed to realize the 4 main-targets.
  I got a little help from some sides but in basics this is
  still a one-man-show :(                                      <br>
                                                               <br>
  The side targets just list some possible things, they
  might be realized if someone pulls himself together, and
  says "yes, I'm gonna do it". However normally people tend 
  to suddenly leave as soon the magic word "work" is 
  dropped, so don't count on these points to be realized :(    <br>
                                                               <br>
  I personally will leave them aside to concentrate on
  the main targets, as said energies are limited, and 
  somedays I feel that I hit the top-limit already.            <br>
                                                               <br>
  <hr><!-------------------------------------------------------->
  <ul>
    <li> 1: Creating an ingame GameMaster-TOOL.                <br>
    <li> 2: A WYSIWYG world/map editor.                        <br>
    <li> 3: Create an offline world with quests etc.           <br>             
    <li> 4: visual AD&D mode.                                  <br>
    <li> 5: visual races.                                      <br>
  </ul>
    
  <hr><!-------------------------------------------------------->
  <br> <br> <ol>
  <li> Having GM-tools in game would allow total
       new possibilities like i.e. a genesis-backbag
       where you create new items by simply dragging 
       them out of it. A global map, teleport by 
       clicking the destination, etc.                            <br>
                                                                 <br>
  <li> Well there only three groups I know so far, that
       managed to actually draw the world: OSI, Menasoft 
       and myself, and I'm the only one giving away source!      <br>
                                                                 <br>
       The world/display concept would allow to create a
       "world" that uses the display to change the .mul
       files.                                                    <br>
                                                                 <br>
  <li> Also one possibility to the world/display concept.
       One could use the umelange display to generate
       an offline game with quests and this stuff. There
       are main differences to an online game, like in 
       example monster spawns. In offline, monsters will
       always spawn where the player doesn't see it, which
       is not possible on an online server.                      <br>
                                                                 <br>
  <li> That's just an idea. It would require huge rewrites
       in server code also, but with UMelange you could display
       the experience-points/level in a character window, 
       creating other common AD&D structures etc.                <br>
                                                                 <br>
       In basics this would be also possible with gumps, but
       you still haven't a possibility to get rid of the
       "normal" skill system. Also gumps are rather 
       difficult to use, and bring a lot of crashes...           <br>
                                                                 <br>
  <li> The thing races were originally invented in UOX. 
       Unfortunately it was soon found out that the client
       wasn't capable to display them, this could change with
       UMelange....
