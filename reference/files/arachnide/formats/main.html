 Here I'll try to collect all what is known of the mul formats... <br>
 Creating a new mul-format-stronghold, a page that is kept alived and is still
 cared about!
 <br>
 <br>
 ~75% of the information here is from Alazane's 
 <a href="http://dkbush.cablenet-va.com/alazane/file_formats.html" target="_new">InsideUO</a> <br>
 Also interesting is Ridcullies 
 <a href="http://www.lasnet.de/jluebbe/uoinsight/index.html" target="_new">UOInsight</a>
 . Unfortunally both side's are abandoned today, and are no longer maintained. <br>
 <br>

 <b>IF YOU HAVE ANY NEW INFO ABOUT MUL FILES OR SOMETHING NOT COVERED BY THIS TUTORIAL, PLEASE TELL!
 &nbsp;&nbsp;( Of course also feel free to tell about any errors!  )<br><br>
